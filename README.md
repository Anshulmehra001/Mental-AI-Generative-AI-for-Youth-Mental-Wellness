## üåü The Problem & Our Solution

In India, millions of young people face immense pressure, but a deep-rooted cultural stigma prevents them from seeking mental health support.

**Mental AI** solves this by providing a confidential, AI-powered companion that transforms the wellness journey into a positive and engaging experience. We eliminate the stigma by visualizing the user's emotional growth as a beautiful, thriving digital plant.

## ‚ú® Core Features

Our goal is to create a complete wellness ecosystem that is both supportive and empowering.

## üîé How it works (quick flow)

- You chat with the AI companion (Gemini) about your day and feelings.
- We analyze the conversation sentiment and context to log a mood entry.
- Your plant gains experience; when XP crosses a threshold, it levels up and visually evolves.
- The Analytics dashboard aggregates conversations, moods, and streaks into simple insights.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create `.env.local` based on `.env.example`:
- VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY: required for AI chat.
- SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: optional; if not provided, the app falls back to browser storage for prototyping.
- VITE_ENABLE_SAMPLE_DATA=true: optional demo seed for quick exploration.

## üöÄ Getting Started (For Judges & Developers)

We've made it as simple as possible to run our prototype.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- An API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

### Quick Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Anshulmehra001/Mental-AI-Generative-AI-for-Youth-Mental-Wellness.git
    cd Mental-AI-Generative-AI-for-Youth-Mental-Wellness
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```
    Now, add your `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` to the newly created `.env.local` file.
    *(Supabase is optional; the app gracefully falls back to local storage.)*

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
The application will now be running on your local machine.

- Personalized wellness journeys (habits, streaks, nudges) with adaptive difficulty.
- Mobile app and offline capabilities for low-connectivity regions.
- Expanded crisis resources with geolocation-aware helplines.
