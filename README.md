## 🌟 The Problem & Our Solution

In India, millions of young people face immense pressure, but a deep-rooted cultural stigma prevents them from seeking mental health support.

**Mental AI** solves this by providing a confidential, AI-powered companion that transforms the wellness journey into a positive and engaging experience. We eliminate the stigma by visualizing the user's emotional growth as a beautiful, thriving digital plant.

## 🚀 Getting Started (For Judges & Developers)

We've made it as simple as possible to run our prototype.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- An API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

### Quick Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Anshulmehra001/Mental-AI-Generative-AI-for-Youth-Mental-Wellness.git
    cd Mental-AI-Generative-AI-for-Youth-Mental-Wellness
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```
    Now, add your `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` to the newly created `.env.local` file.
    *(Supabase is optional; the app gracefully falls back to local storage.)*

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
The application will now be running on your local machine.
